# steam-ext-dota2

An extension to interact with the DOTA 2 Game Coordinator for 
[steam.py](https://github.com/Gobot1234/steam.py). `dota2.Client` and `dota2.Bot` are `steam.Client` and `commands.Bot` 
subclasses respectively, so whatever you did with `steam`/`ext.commands` you can do with `ext.dota2`
